**How can I push to my fork from a clone of the original repo?
I created a fork (let's call it myrepo) of another repository (let's call it orirepo) on GitHub. Later, I cloned orirepo.
git clone https://github.com/original/orirepo.git
I modified about 20 files, then I staged my change and made a commit
git add
git commit
However, when I tried to push
git push
I got this error:
remote: Permission to original/orirepo.git denied to mylogin.
fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/original/orirepo.git/': The requested URL returned error: 403

==> Solution: 
	  git remote set-url origin http://github.com/myname/reponame 
and then  git push origin mybranch

**How do I push to GitHub under a different username?

==> Solution: 
	git config --local credential.helper ""
	git push origin master
It will prompt for username and password
git config credential.helper store
